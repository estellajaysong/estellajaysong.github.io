      Hi, I’m Estella. I am a back end developer by day, dreamer by night. My path started in the
      service industry, through legal, and into tech, where I’ve finally found a home in the craft,
      the spirit, and the community. My calling is empowering myself and others through
      knowledge-sharing and tool-building, and I am relentless in this pursuit. I am keen on
      tackling big, challenging problems, and will hit the ground running every single day with the
      wind in my hair and a big smile on my face.
    </p>

    <p className="mt-6">
      It's important to me that I not only improve the experience of our customers, but also my
      coworkers, the tech community, and hopefully one day, the world. I've got grit, I value
      honesty, and I take pride in what I do.
    </p>
